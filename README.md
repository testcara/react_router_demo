# React Router Demo

Here is one react demo for react router learning.
We can set the routes in one main page or the routes.js as a whole.

We tried the both.

- For the 'routers.js', enjoy the first [commit](https://github.com/testcara/react_router_demo/commit/f4213d0daf271dc1bc8de12753538720d5fcb96b).
- For setting routes in one page, please check the first [commit](https://github.com/testcara/react_router_demo/commit/6346bb1c81540133df3563d53bf5294b54e1cc64).

The first commit we mentiond above contains more useful usages like urlparamersand queryparameters. If you would like to know more details, check the ```src/*.js```.

If you would like to check it in your local environment, you just need to ```yarn start```.
